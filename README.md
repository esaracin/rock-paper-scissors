A simple n-gram implementation of an AI that plays Rock Paper Scissors. A very weak algorithm
simply counts the last n moves of the human player, and throws the option that opposes that move.

To run the game, simply type 'python main.py' (without the single quotes),
and follow the on screen prompts. At any time, simply enter q or cntrl + c 
to end the game, and have stats printed out about your progress.

Python 3 is required to run this program.
